edit full original post left edit reference thank helpful interesting comments far even incorrect still helpful makes think critically detail certain aspects would work xyz wouldn't work appreciate comments critical otherwise anyways throughout discussions last day definitely helped clearer idea mind needs etc well made think hard areas allowed come new ideas well get though wanted put part front center believe it's biggest question need answered biggest question mark whole idea work new thread brief i'm hoping design turbocharger setup car runs additional boost beyond gets engine bleed excess air cool intake air well ambient hopefully allow running lower octane gas possibly also advance timing depending cold get mind big question get turbocharger output enough additional pressure flow beyond air getting engine therefore pushing turbine wasted bleed air system practical main reason posted engineering sub reddit somewhere else need someone familiar gas turbines turbochargers hopefully give least ball park numbers equations calculate plausible would get turbo output say 66 air going engine therefore much less mass air pushing turbine touched seems likely idea would work even obtain 33 capacity possibly though additional hardware even 17 someone could give even ballpark idea much additional energy available turbine typical turbocharged setup you're reached full boost pressure car set since wastegate typical setup open least partially whenever build full boost definition must least extra energy available spool turbo question much mind additional thoughts things wanted point end edit marked original post reference although may things incorrect date one important question asked want science experiment want car works thought don't think necessarily mutually exclusive plenty research planning first realized important know idea works willing take risks car find long design fail safes system think risk engine minimal point though would better think science experiment see theory works wouldn't posted engineering board simply wanted normal turbo kit install used work motorsports shop know part ok mind think would helpful re describe project different manner much emphasis certain key areas first want state would helpful look whole system type gas turbine system engine piston engine simply one component diagram one big advantages gas turbine engines systems things different stages e cool heat air heat exchangers compression even stages compression along lines thinking think would helpful people look diagram air cycle machine basically hvac unit airplanes planes 2 3 runs bleed air planes jet engines apu gas turbine engines produce shaft power turbofan engines anyway see diagram one air cycle machine there's many different models course shows air temperatures different points system http www eurocooling com public_html articleanconafigure2 gif read wikipedia article https en wikipedia org wiki air_cycle_machine system doesn't need nearly complicated since doesn't things air cycle machine machines amongst things exact type thing i'm trying take bleed air cool proves aspect physics idea sound get things need correct something believe thinking wrong originally example estimating 0.5 bar boost would get engine 1.0 bar boost would bled cooling much could get turbo put total boost 1.5 bar estimate still stands however originally incorrectly thinking since 0.5 half 1.0 2 3rd air coming turbo wasted bleed air therefore you'd need turbo 3 times big terms mass flow capabilities would air going engine error looking numbers absolute pressure 0.5 bar boost engine 1.5 bar absolute pressure bleed air additional 1 bar boost brings total needed 2.5 bar absolute vs 1.5 bar absolute running normal setup 0.5 bar boost bleed air approximately 66 additional airflow needed 200 originally thinking far practical goal also note turbo cars often 30 50 additional capacity turbo available may require turbocharger slightly bigger average turns enough energy available beyond 1.0 bar bleed air we'll cross bridge get yes aware near 100 capacity turbo start getting substantially excess heat due turbo's efficiency range go close enough it's maximum capacity regular basis reliability turbo serious factor hence i'm looking use somewhat substantially larger turbo i've done math right used online calculator possible got something wrong someone double check numbers reach 2.5 bar absolute cool 175 degrees f standard intercooler drop 1.5 bar absolute example would drop 78 deg f i'll rounding numbers even intercooler could cool air 250 f assuming pressure drop would still bring 34 f i'm confident would plenty enough drop achieve primary goal alternatively can't reach full bar boost beyond gets engine much likely scenario let's say reach 2.0 bar absolute drops us 0.5 bar 7.3 psi bleed air assuming 175 f intercooler that's still 16 f likely enough accomplish primary goal also low boost levels intercooler could probably cool air lot honestly estimates probably high let's say could get air 125 f intercooler 0.5 bar pressure drop we're 21 f reality want run cool air possibly allows us run aggressive timing possibly lean engine little make power less fuel may also help spool turbo even i'm sure part though assuming simply dump bleed air waste energy additional idea turbo without additional help push slightly pressure engine sees let's say 0.25 bar 3.675 psi need help get reference let's say 125 f intercooler output temp we're 0.75 bar boost point pushing turbo ton heat drops 41 f 0.5 bar boost engine sees 1.5 bar absolute cool really cold however take bleed air run heat exchanger incoming air could cool even first bleed air would decompressed right bat loosing 0.5 bar engine intake depending pipe sizes heat exchanger size flow may decompress possibly way argument's sake i'll use possibly pessimistic estimate dropping half it's remaining pressure absolute additional 0.125 bar bringing 1.125 bar absolute would bring temperature 84 f even doesn't lose additional pressure you're still looking 42 f anyways you'd two options point possibly combining could either put heat exchanger intercooler cool full flow turbo could put heat exchanger intake turbo assuming doesn't create much resistance nullify benefit latter cooling air goes turbocharger's compressor actually make easier compress air means turbocharger could push even pressure flow amount exhaust energy pushing turbine exactly need depending much bleed air volume available could possibly put heat exchanger locations run either parallel sequence additionally depending cool air still running one heat exchangers long it's appreciably ambient normally assumed around 70 deg f could put final point vent atmosphere facing hot side regular intercooler front car side note since two objects heat exchangers intercoolers don't worry getting outside airflow could put fender wells something like like side mount intercooler there's insufficient space engine bay probably would space 1 depending much additional boost turbo push effective heat exchanger may need 1 0 also note things like using equal length turbo manifold ceramic coating exhaust manifold turbine housing keeps lot heat inside would help improve efficiently turbine uses heat energy available engine would allow build yet boost engine seeing another possibly large factor would choosing right r ratio turbine housing may need one that's aimed quick spool time instead top end flow another area i'd love get feedback reference i'm likely going use dsm 90 99 mitsubishi eclipse etc turbo specifically evo 3 16g turbo extremely common upgrade dsms may option change turbine housing need different r ratio also t25 turbo stock second generation dsm eclipse etc turbo smaller may option turns don't need something big 16g use smaller turbo get engine able spool much past engine flow need end edit original post title somewhat self explanatory general idea let give details mind normally turbocharger car air coming compressor side turbocharger forced engine's intake regulation pressure done turbine side turbocharger opening wastegate let excess exhaust gasses keep compression pressure k boost intake side desired pressure reached commonly somewhere range 7 20 psi factory settings case i'd like try allow turbocharger build boost well beyond you're planning actually giving engine yes choosing properly sized turbo that's larger would usually needed important standard air turbo run intercooler larger normal one would needed key difference i'd like try bleeding air somewhere far side intercooler throttle body since air heats compressed cools decompressed since we're cooling intercooler it's compressed allowing partially decompress cooled much depends much pressure you're bleeding much cooled beforehand may need try different amounts boost engine get work reference point i'd like start 7 9 psi getting engine modest conservative amount looking crazy power numbers idea works well could raised get turbocharger put 22 psi you're allowing 7 psi engine you're bleeding full 1 bar pressure would appreciable amount cooling perfect scenario could actually run 30 40 psi bleed 7 would massive amount cooling there's online calculators calculate realize it's highly unlikely you'd ever reach though explained anyways reference test theory i'm thinking installing extra wastegate intake pipe little ways throttle body using boost controller connected intake manifold regulate set 7 psi safely measure second line boost controller connected wastegate turbo set slightly higher pressure e 9 psi case anything fails earlier setup boost controllers used wastegates don't open they've reached desired pressure since it's probably going get asked i'm hoping try turbocharging 90s port fuel injection engine safely without lower compression ratio going methanol injection always buy methanol idea works well though could applied performance purposes different vehicles well engine 9.5 1 10 1 compression yes i'm aware might practical run 7 psi without detonation it's somewhat gray area also i'm curious idea works applications performance reasons heavily built engine could much interesting ok that's theory question idea hold physics standpoint suppose tried manner i'm told tried naturally aspirated fashion turbocharger cool air boost bled theoretically additional pressure makes engine cooler air i'm told basically didn't work lost much air velocity pressure dropped i'm guessing didn't work means wasn't beneficial sorry knowing details something friend told therefore it's possible incorrect please let know i'm wrong theory since i'm actually going running boost engine definition velocity problems solved could wrong thinking long you're regulating bleed valve keep manifold pressure desired setting case 7 psi velocity drops pressure would drop therefore you're allowing enough pressure past bleed valve theory you've built boost there's always going excess pressure available need get manifold correct i'm wrong understanding physics side note realize there's going massive turbulence airflow bleed air ideally using smaller piping bleed point etc things like equal length turbo manifold ceramic coating manifold turbo would also help well course there's definitely going much room improvement right i'm concerned theory possible practical best guess what's going biggest pitfall theory turbocharger probably going produce much boost desired normally continue spool turbocharger higher higher boost within limits engine turbocharger you're running boost air's going engine means much air pushing turbine spool turbo even faster case that's happening you've reached desired intake manifold pressure case 7 psi beyond you're hoping turbo continue produce yet boost without additional air pushing turbine fact wastegates needed proves least excess energy available definitely run boost what's going engine big question much also ways effect would choosing turbocharger restrictive r ratio help normally used reduce spool time turbo lag restrictive top end would require custom turbine housing looking time theory would needed massively beneficial realize there's definitely going average amount turbo lag you're going use turbocharger substantially bigger normally would i'm assuming ultimate issue turbocharger isn't going produce enough boost beyond you're letting engine beneficial practical e 4 psi never know unless try right also even reached say 4 psi extra first spooled possible may appreciably rise engine rpms get higher rpms engine's peek torque range relevant thoughts comments ideas reasons may may work i'd love hear thank advice help give reference i'm never taken official engineering classes worked automotive motorsports shop several years i've done lot self study turbochargers engine design gas turbine theory understand basics p there's different sub reddit would

hi first sorry imperfect english work mechanical designer professional training contract still beginner company offering engineering studies automotive industry would like use topology optimization technique early design process generate shapes forms components designs certainly know topology optimization softwares like hyperworks optistruct solidthinking inspire tosca structure example requires defining design space loads boundary conditions optimization problem mainly determine design space start nothing indeed quite easier use topology optimization re designing product take geometry past product re designed removing features building envelope past product use design space start blank page designing totally new innovative mechanical component question ask estimate good preliminary rough design space maybe question much clearer use examples let's say want design structural part internal combustion engine first determine envelope maximum space volume part designing one possible methodology would start large volume subtract volume surrounding components another example want design car structure one possible methodology example determine envelope structure going optimize start styling envelope exterior volume car subtract volume component car volumes like volume occupants volume trunk etc styling envelope obtained structure envelope still define design non design space keep interfaces attachment points etc previous examples gave see already lot information volume system volume components etc available design easily create model select design non design space go bit let's say want design innovative mechanism different non standard components bodies would start preliminary design process defining topology mechanism maybe draw kinematic diagram also called kinematic scheme skeleton diagram next step give preliminary rough shape body embodiment design use topology optimization find optimal final geometry finding preliminary rough shape obvious think shape chosen carefully avoid missing good alternative structural concepts methodology see moment old trial error looking systematic methodology think maybe find answer question necessary understand traditional embodiment design phase preliminary design phase mechanical design process writing today hoping able give advices references book publications maybe lines thought studies found least practical learning materials methodologies guidelines preliminary design process assembly part level structures mechanisms particularly looking methodologies guidelines configuration design shape form design configuration design think synthesis architecture mechanical product structure mechanism arrangement individual components determination interfaces decide interface interfaces look like preliminary sizing connections etc space allocation volume envelope component weight allocation also understanding system engineers architects allocate space mechanical part could help lot determining preliminary design space shape form design mean determining rough preliminary geometry topology synthesis mechanical part expected loads requirements functional interfaces etc done didn topology optimization technique think david g ullman book mechanical design process provides us interesting breakdown form generation process part embodiment design understanding constraints developing configuration connections components looking since long time case study would present design mechanical system preliminary hand sketches final design showing iterations details done digital mock first cad models final models think would instructive understand mechanical design process also studied systems engineering little really understand seems one stops systems engineering process engine sub system level example component level mechanical component seen system actually looking methodologies methods processes guidelines etc could called mechanical mechatronical sub systems engineering example functional analysis widely taught mechanical design courses france big gap functional analysis functional architecture mechanical architecture seems nobody able write methodologies guidelines would address issue even possible lack insight hindsight subjects hope questions still comprehensible short list learning materials subject mechanical design process book david g ullman interesting chapter form generation succinct pity think one rare texts dealing subject systematic design famous engineering design systematic approach book pahl beitz interesting also deals little preliminary design
