# TextRank Summarization

## Requirements

This requires Python 2, as well as the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) for Python. Anaconda also runs the program fine.

## Running the Program

To run the program, call:
```
python textrank.py subreddit.xml
```
`subreddit.xml` should be generated using the Data Collection program for this project.

## Output

The program will print many lines to inform the user about progress in the algorithm. At the end, the program will print its summary for the subreddit.
